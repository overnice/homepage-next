# Rock the boat
### Concept, user experience and interface, handling and execution.

The Web3 Summit is a well respected and high-quality conference. They implemented a no-promotion policy for good reasons, as many conferences are riddled with rampant advertisements, bought speaking opportunities and massive sponsoring. 
We had to make sure not to draw the anger of the organizers and the visitors on us for ruining their non-bullshit conference. 
But to justify breaking this rule, we had to come up with something that would create attention in a meaningful way — in a way that added value, not only to the attendees but hopefully to the organizers as well.

The rough idea: Get a boat, put a giant billboard on it, develop a cryptocurrency faucet, embed it in a nice webapp and link to the it from the giant QR code that is displayed on the billboard. 
## From idea to execution in less than two weeks
We found ourselves with an idea and less than two weeks to do all of that and — most importantly — decide whether this was a good idea and if we had the guts to take the risk.
From trouble with the German water police to hate from the community to simply not being able to finish the app in time — the list of things that could go wrong was daunting.
In the end, the reason we ran with it was the team’s spirit. Team Nimiq and we liked the idea and liked doing something bold. 
## The beauty of the struggle

While the developers worked overtime, the billboard was set up by our trusted handymen and a user experience was designed that pushed Nimiq’s ease-of-use principle even further.

We had cross about 50km of German rivers and lakes to get the boat to its designated place of action and moved in with our office, putting finishing touches on everything.

Stormy weather, bridges that were almost too low to pass, the motor dying minutes before the event, the police, the app itself — it all worked like a charm in the end. Even the organizers seemed to like the attention and the effort that we had put into their summit.

## The app behind the boat
Visitors could scan the QR code or visit [getsome.nimiq.com](https://getsome.nimiq.com/) to create a cryptocurrency wallet in their phone’s browser and receive 1000 NIM – all in under two minutes. 
If they felt like continuing with their experience they could visit the Nimiq online shop and try the online checkout experience, spending their NIM on merch or browsing the Nimiq app ecosystem.
## Results
In total, [getsome.nimiq.com](https://getsome.nimiq.com/) was opened 792 times by 682 unique visitors, of whom 85% successfully created a wallet in their browser. Many more saw Nimiq’s freshly redesigned brand, with the boat being positioned at the sole entry point to the conference.
