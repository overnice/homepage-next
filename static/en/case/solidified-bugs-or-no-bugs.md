IT-security is becoming increasingly crucial for our world to function. Blockchain technology provides many solutions but, like with every new technology, it comes with a set of new challenges.
<!-- {.text-right} -->

Being immutable is one of the significant advantages of a blockchain. Being immutable also means that coding errors, vulnerabilities and bugs cannot be fixed after they were released. 

Solidified provides code reviews by renowned experts. But room for human error and abuse still persists. So the companies researchers developed a system that utilizes game theory to align incentives and to distributes the burden of making sure that no mistake is left: The bug prediction market. 

We supported the fundraising campaign with marketing advice and content production.

## ELI5
Reducing complexity and packaging complicated matters into easy-to-get pieces is what we love to do. To illustrate the sophisticated system, we developed a flow chart, visually explaining the Bug Prediction Market with crisp steps explaining the behaviour of the various actors.

For underlining the technical aspiration of the project, we felt an infographic might be too old-school. So we went ahead and built an interactive experience. Users could follow the ‘swimming lanes’ and mouse-over items to receive more in detail info.

## Putting faces on it
Even with interactive experiences and infographics, such a highly technical and complicated matter remains abstract and is hard to trust. Together with our friends from Monic, we produced some high-quality videos where the actual inventors and the team behind the Bug Prediction Market explains their reasoning and enthusiasm.

[Video](TBD)

For the more technical people, we designed the so-called whitepaper, an in-depth description of the system’s design and functionality. While the infographic and interactive experience aimed to be accessible and easy-to-get, the whitepaper is supposed to catch the academic quality and aspiration of the project.
