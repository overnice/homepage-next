IT security is becoming an increasingly high-stakes issue in our world today. Blockchain technology provides many solutions but, like every new technology, it comes with a set of new challenges.

Being immutable is one of the significant advantages of a blockchain. But being immutable also means that coding errors, vulnerabilities and bugs cannot be fixed after they were released. 

Solidified provides code reviews by renowned experts. But room for human error remains and abuse still persists. So the companies researchers developed a system that utilizes game theory to align incentives and share the burden of eliminating mistakes: The Bug Prediction Market. 

We supported the fundraising campaign with marketing advice and content production.

## ELI5
Reducing complexity and packaging complicated matters into easy-to-get pieces is what we love to do. To illustrate the sophisticated system, we developed a flow chart, visually explaining the Bug Prediction Market with crisp steps explaining the behaviour of the various actors.

To underline the technical aspirations of the project, we felt an infographic might be too old-school. So we went ahead and built an interactive experience. Users could follow the ‘swimming lanes’ and mouse-over items to receive more detailed info.

## Putting faces on it
Even with interactive experiences and infographics, such a highly technical and complicated matter remains abstract and is hard to trust. Together with our friends at [Monic Films](https://www.monicfilms.de) and DOP [Alexander Schmutzler](https://alxschmtzlr.com/) produced some high-quality videos in which the actual inventors and the team behind the Bug Prediction Market explain their reasoning and enthusiasm.

For the more tech-savvy, we designed the so-called ‘whitepaper’ - an in-depth description of the system’s design and functionality. While the infographic and interactive experience aimed to be accessible and easy to grasp, the white paper is intended to catch the academic quality and aspiration of the project.
