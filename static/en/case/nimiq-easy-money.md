Nimiq is cryptocurrency designed for simplicity and ease-of-use. It is special for it is written in Javascript and Rust which allows for a download and installation free usage, directly in the browser. The project aspires to bring the benefits of blockchain to everyone – even non-technical users.

Still, blockchain and cryptocurrency remain highly complicated matters, surrounded by a repelling air of lawlessness. In total, immense challenges for user experience, interface and messaging that we excitedly accepted. 

> We got to work with a bold aspiration: Create the easiest, most convenient and most accessible cryptocurrency experience in existence.

## Easy orientation
Every screen, every step should focus on one single action, allowing for focus and guidance at all times. A progress bar was introduced to provide direction for users and to indicate that user flows never contain more than four steps.

## Easy wording 
Many of the blockchain specific concepts and terms are unknown to most and especially hard to get for non-technical people. So for Nimiq, we altogether avoided crypto slang and used established concepts where possible, reducing the cognitive load to a minimum. 

The concept of private keys and public keys, seed words, Image Wallets etc. were replaced by easy to grasp and descriptive names. The ‘seed words’ for example, became the account’s ‘Recovery Words’, indicating what a user can use these words for: account recovery.  

The wording is reduced to a minimum and focuses on providing precise info and guidance.

## Easy onboarding
We took our time to design the entrance to the Nimiq blockchain that has one clear cut goal: Be easy.
The radically simplified account creation consists of only two steps: Choosing an avatar and setting a password. And just like that, the user becomes a first-class citizen of the Nimiq Blockchain. 

We believe it to be the easiest and fastest onboarding for any payment system, crypto or conventional. Our estimated Account creation time is way below 30 seconds, faster than any email address creation and Facebook’s or Google’s onboarding.

## Easy security
Nimiq is a decentralized payment system and as such, it can’t be secure enough, but security and convenience often oppose each other when it comes to User Experience. 

We couldn’t sacrifice the user’s security for his convenience, so recontextualized it. A user starts with low security, increasing it step by step along his user journey. This way, we allow the user to give Nimiq a try without having to commit too much time and effort to it.

## Easy payments
Paying with NIM should be at least as easy as paying with PayPal. We designed an all-new online-checkout flow that allows for such super quick and convenient payments – even though it’s cryptocurrency that is being transferred.

Select NIM as your way to pay, enter your password and confirm the transaction with one final click. A light and enjoyable experience that provides high reliability and control nonetheless. 

## Easy reproduction
Nimiq is a community-driven open-source project. We aimed for interfaces that are so simple and basic that they can serve as a boilerplate for the community. 

## Give it a try
