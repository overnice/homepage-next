## Brand new Money
We were thrilled to be invited to the so-called ‘Nerd Temple’ in fair Costa Rica. There, we found a group of incredibly talented people who shared a vision we could get behind: Bring the benefits of blockchain technology to everyone by building a cryptocurrency so easy and convenient to use and understand that even your grandma can manage it. 

> We were tasked with creating a full rebranding and got straight to work.
While the old branding was considered to be lacking in many regards, both by the team and the community, there was a heritage to acknowledge and to honour in our rebranding. 

## Getting the fundamentals right

We interviewed the whole team, stakeholders, and about ten community members to establish an authentic, first-hand understanding of what we were trying to brand here. In workshops and group discussions, an increasingly clear identity emerged, and we were able to quickly capture and refine the results.

To create an easily relatable brand, free from cryptic marketing jargon, a brand persona was developed that features various character traits, strengths and weaknesses and a set of things this fictional person is passionate about. 

Vision and mission were discussed at length and iterated on until everyone in the team came to a shared and aligned understanding of what the project was aiming to accomplish.

## A new logo – radical simplicity

One of the most important values Nimiq strives for is simplicity. In the belief that stripping away everything that is superfluous will lead to less cognitive load and ultimately to a better experience.

This radical simplicity sparked controversy within the community and the stakeholders: ‘Can a hexagon be a logo?’ ‘Is this too simple?’

> But we were convinced: It’s the only true representation of Nimiq and its identity.
In the web-based styleguide that everyone can access and use to build on, we presented our reasons and the community agreed.

1. The logo fully delivers on being simple and on being special.
2. It’s an iconic shape that works internationally (unlike the Latin “n”).
3. The focus on the form itself enhances the valuable resemblance to a coin, the sun, or a piece of gold.
4. In contrast to the vast array of clever and overly detailed crypto logos, the simplicity really stands out. 
5. Most of all, it’s an ecosystem-first logo. In its simplicity, it leaves enough room for others to build on. It’s not just a logo in the traditional sense, but rather a symbol – a boilerplate intended to be varied and reproduced, a clean slate to be painted on.

## A new font  
Finding an appropriate font proved tricky. It needed to: 

1. Add to the simplicity,
2. while being somewhat caracteristic to compensate for the minimalist logo and
3. be open source and internationally applicable.


After a lot of research, we found what we were looking for: Muli.

It’s a very plain and straightforward sans serif but has subtle, expressive accents that make it stand out. Furthermore, Muli is on Google Fonts and its source code is publicly accessible on Github.

## Primary Colors

We use traditional, basic colors with relation to payments, but with a subtle, unexpected spin. The ultramarine dark-blue with a subtle hint of violet spreading from the corner. The classic red that slightly turns into magenta.

A light stage was chosen to underline Nimiq’s transparent, open and collaborative approach. Within this light stage, we can create structure through the use of very light, nuanced grays that are based on our main color palette.

While a deep ultramarine embodies trust and reliability, values not generally associated with the traditional financial sector, a bright tone of gold conveys value and warmth.

## Secondary Colours

Nimiq’s main brand touchpoint are its interfaces, so we chose the secondary color palette to support interactions and interface feedback: A classic light blue for neutral highlights, mint green for success, vivid orange for strong highlights and warnings, and a rich red to express danger.

## All about accessibility 
Nimiq is a web-based technology. The branding reflects this and so we decided to let the presentation of the branding reflect it as well.
