## Brand new Money
We were thrilled to be invited to the so called ‘Nerd Temple’ in fair Costa Rica. There, we found a group of incredibly talented people that shared a vision we could get behind: Bring the benefits of blockchain technology to everyone by building a cryptocurrency so easy and convenient to use and understand that your grandma would be able to use it. 

> We were tasked to create a full rebranding and got right to work.
While the old branding was considered to be lacking in many regards by the team and the community alike, there was a heritage to consider and to honour in our rebranding. 

## Getting the fundamentals right
We interviewed the whole team, stakeholders and about ten community members to establish a authentic and first-hand understanding of what we were trying to brand here. In workshops and group discussions, an increasingly clear identity emerged and we were quick to capture and refine the results.

To enable an easily relatable brand free from cryptic marketing speech, a brand persona was developed that features various character traits, strengths and weaknesses and a set of things this fictional person is passionate about. 

Vision and mission were heavily discussed and iterated on until everyone in the team had a shared and aligned understanding of what the project was aiming to accomplish. 

## A new logo – radical simplicity 
![Nimiq logo scatches and scribbles](/cases/branding_nimiq/logosketches.jpeg)

One of the most important values Nimiq strives for is simplicity. In the belief that stripping away everything unnecessary will lead to less cognitive load and eventually to a better experience. We took that aspiration and applied it directly to the logo creation. 

This radical simplicity sparked a controversy amongst the community and the stakeholders. ‘Can a hexagon be a logo, is this too simple?’

> We were convinced: It’s the only true representation of Nimiq and it’s identity.
Along the web-based styleguide that everyone can access and use to build on, we presented our reasons and the community agreed.

1. The logo fully delivers on being simple and on being special
2. It’s an iconic shape that works internationally (unlike the Latin “n”).
3. The focus on the shape itself enhances the valuable resemblance of a coin, the sun or a piece of gold.
4. In contrast to the vast array of clever and overly detailed crypto-logos, the simplicity really stands out. 
5. Most of all, it’s an ecosystem-first logo. In its simplicity, it leaves enough room for others to build on. It’s not just a logo in the traditional sense, but rather a symbol – a boilerplate intended to be varied and reproduced, a clean slate to be painted on.

## A new font  
Finding a appropriate Font was tricky. It needed to 

1. Add to the simplicity,
2. Be open source and internationally applicable
3. Not overused to compensate for the simple logo,

After quite some research, we found what we were looking for: Muli.

It’s a very plain and simple sans-serif but has subtle, expressive accents that make it stand out. Furthermore, Muli is on Google Fonts and its source code is publicly accessible on Github.

## Primary Colours

We use traditional, basic colors with relation to payments, but with a subtle, unexpected spin. The ultramarine dark-blue with a subtle touch of violet, spread from the corner. The classic red that slightly turns into magenta.

A light stage was choosen to underline Nimiq’s transparent, open and collaborative approach. Within this light stage, we can create structure through the use of very light, nuanced grays that are based on our main colors.

While a dark ultramarine embodies trust and reliability, ajar to the traditional financial sector, a  bright tone of gold transports value and warmth.

## Secondary Colours

Nimiq’s main brand touchpoint is interfaces so we choose the secondary color palette to support interactions and interface feedback: A light classic blue for neutral highlights, a mint green for success, a vivid orange for strong highlights and warnings, and a rich red to express danger.

## All about accessibility 
Nimiq is a web based technology. The branding reflects this and so we decided to let the presentation of the branding reflect it as well.
