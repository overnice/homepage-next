Vodafone is the largest provider of mobile phone services in Germany and, with about 20% market share, the country’s second largest broadband internet provider. This makes Vodafone responsible for the connectivity of over 10 million people.

## Shared interests

Stable and reliable access to the World Wide Web is pretty much vital for most. For Vodafone, it’s a priority to spare their customers the grief and frustration of not being able to connect to the internet. Getting disconnected customers reconnected requires a costly and care-intensive customer service process.

Internal research by Vodafone found that a whopping portion of these service enquiries can be resolved with the same simple actions. The customer can easily perform most of these actions in their internet-less home. Top of the list: Turning it off – and on again.

So Vodafone and their customers share a problem: Expensive/annoying service calls. And, even worse: More expensive and more annoying technician appointments.

Our friends at Hackerbay tasked us with developing User Experience, interface and messaging for a digital solution to enable customers to debug their connection autonomously.

A chatbot type of system was identified as the most suitable format, optimized for still-connected mobile phones. First, the user specifies the setup and type of connection. Secondly, the user is  guided to perform the task that is statistically most likely to fix the problem.

The challenge: Making the experience as pleasant as possible, and maintaining the user’s motivation to perform all the steps.

With 24 possible hardware setups and a multitude of potentially decisive factors, from power supply to cables to a poorly placed wifi router, we had first to map out all the possible scenarios and routes.

## Being sensitive

Acknowledging the user’s situation – being in distress and having to deal with a problem – we reduced design and language to a minimum. A user should be able to perform the tasks as fast and frictionlessly as possible, without being distracted by branding, ads and pseudo-social messages from a bot.

Precise wording was crafted, and descriptive visuals and icons were used where possible. Vodafone’s corporate design offered extensive resources, such as icons, guide videos and pictures of the LED feedback for each router. Still, there were moments when we felt a custom-made icon was needed. We were delighted when Vodafone not only approved these extensions, but decided to adopt them into their official brand assets.

## Not taking “Contact support” for an answer 
We aspired to offer a solution, no matter what the user’s problem. So we constantly challenged the process and convinced our client to include aspects that exceeded the initially planned scope. For example, if the user’s input identify a cable to be the likely cause of the problem. Instead of dropping the user at this point, where no action within the user’s home or directly from Vodafone could resolve the issue, we refused to display the “No solution, contact support” screen – our nemesis for this project. Instead, we provided a link to a map with the nearest electronics retailer and a link to the specific cable on Amazon.

## Saving budget with UX
A new customer of Vodafone would receive their router with a QR code which would link to the bot already containing some information about the user’s specifics. But for the over 10 million existing customers, the client struggled with distribution of the QR codes.

The idea was to send the QR codes as stickers via mail. But printing and sending this many individual stickers would have significantly multiplied the overall cost of the project.  

So we developed a solution that solved the problem more or less for free: Every user would receive an SMS with a phone book contact. This contact was dubbed the “Vodafone Netzassistent” (German for “Vodafone Network Assistant”) and contained a link which led directly to the bot. This meant that the service would be as accessible as a user’s phone contact and, on top of that, it would be easily shareable with anyone requiring its help.

The project was set up and concluded in less than three months, thanks to design sprints and a great team spirit between the amazing people involved from Vodafone’s side, Hackerbay and us.
