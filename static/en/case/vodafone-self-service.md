Vodafone is the largest provider of mobile phone services in Germany and with about 20% market share the second largest provider of broadband internet. This makes Vodafone responsible for the connectivity of +10 million people. 

## Shared interests
Stable and reliable access to the World Wide Web is close to vital for most. For Vodafone, it’s a priority to spare their customers the grieve and frustration of not being able to connect. At the same time, the disconnected require a cost and care intensive customer service. Internal research found that a whopping portion of these service inquiries can be resolved with the same, simple actions. The customer can easily perform most of them within her or his internet-less home. Top of the list: Turning it off - and on again. 

So Vodafone and their customers share a problem: Expansive/annoying service calls and even worse: More expensive and more annoying technician appointments.

Our friends at Hackerbay tasked us to develop the User Experience, Interface and Messaging for a digital solution to enable customers to debug their connection autonomously.

A chat-bot type of system was identified as the most suitable format, optimized for the still connected mobile phones. First, a user should specify the setup and the type of connection. Secondly, the user should be guided to perform the statistically most promising task to fix the problem.

The challenge: Making this as pleasant as possible and keeping the motivation up to perform all the steps.

With 24 possible hardware setups and a multitude of potentially decisive factors, from the power connection to cables to a poorly placed wifi router, we had first to map out all the possible scenarios and routes.  

## Being sensitive
![Router selcetion for the Vodafone Netzassitent](/cases/product_vodafone/routerselection.jpg)
Acknowledging the user’s situation – being in distress and having to deal with a problem – we reduced design and language to a minimum. A user should be able to fulfill the tasks as fast and frictionless as possible and not be distracted with branding, ads and pseudo-social messages from a bot. 

A clear cut wording was crafted and descriptive visuals and icons were used where possible. Vodafone’s corporate design offered extensive resources like icons, guide videos or pictures of the LED feedbacks for each router. Still, at some points, we felt like a custom made icon was needed. We were all the more happy as Vodafone not only approved of these extensions but decided to adopt them into their official brand assets. 

Not taking “Contact support” for an answer 
We aspired to provide a solution no matter the user’s problem. So we constantly challenged the process and convinced our client to include aspects that exceed the extent initially planned for. For example, the user’s input would identify a cable to be likely causing the problem. Instead of dropping the user of at this point, where no action within the user’s home or directly from Vodafone could resolve the issue, we refused to display the “No solution, contact support” screen – our nemesis for this project. Instead, we provided a link to a map with the nearest electronics retailer and a link to the specific cable on Amazon.

## Saving budget with UX
A new customer of Vodafone would receive their router with a QR code which would link to the bot already containing some information about the user’s specifics. But for the over 10 million existing customers, the client struggled with the distribution. 

The idea was to send the QR codes as stickers via mail. But printing and sending this much individual stickers would have significantly multiplied the project’s overall costs.

So we developed a solution that solved the problem more or less for free: Every user would receive an SMS with a phone book contact. This contact was dubbed the “Vodafone Netzassistent” and contained a link which led directly to the bot. This way, the service would be as accessible as a user’s phone contact and on top, it would be easily shareable with whoever requires its help.

The project was set up and concluded in less than three months, enabled by design sprints and a great team spirit between the amazing people involved from Vodafone’s site, Hackerbay and us.
