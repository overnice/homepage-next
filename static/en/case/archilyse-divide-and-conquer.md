Archilyse is a Swiss prop-tech startup that was founded by academics from ETH Zürich. The unique approach combines a properties’s floor plan and other project-specific information with publicly available data about its environment, such as sunlight, traffic intensity, air quality, public transportation etc. 

The results are unmatched architectural analyses empowered by machine learning and automatization.

## Two sides of the same coin 
Archilyse is trying to bridge the gap between the rather traditional and conservative Swiss real estate market and the vibrant and progressive field of AI and data science. 

To develop a brand is very much like developing a character. It has to be likeable and approachable, but without edge it’s prone to being generic and thus forgettable.

Working with brand personas is a tool we find very useful for establishing and sharing an understanding of what a brand should convey. As it takes away a lot of the abstractness, it is a great way to include everyone within an organization in the process.

Workshops foster an instantaneous way of discussing and iterating a brand that makes the process efficient and – to be honest – way more fun.

So together with the founders, we developed a dual-brand structure that catered to both stakeholder groups, without diluting the brand’s identity.

Archilyse is the effective, innovative and technocratic brand. As a SaaS, it’s market-oriented and profit-driven. It’s a rather humorless affair and communication is always straight to the point.

Archilyse Labs is Archilyse’s sub-brand and represents the research and development department. It is a mostly autonomous unit, which fulfills its functions with its own brand identity. In contrast to Archilyse, it’s an open, inclusive and outgoing brand, intended to appeal to young and international academics.

Each brand accomplishes its own designated tasks and caters to its specific audiences, shielding each other from negative effects and utilizing synergy where desirable.

## Deriving the visual identity

The Weissenhof Grotesk font struck us as ideal for Archilyse. It is a constructed geometric sans serif font and is inspired by the Weissenhof Estate, an architecturally avant-garde building complex built in 1927 in Stuttgart, Germany.

The color palette had to be able to cater to the demands of both sides of the brand and their respective target audiences. We focused mainly on the business-centric SaaS brand, Archilyse, and chose a classic set of blue and petrol. The accent color, however, was chosen to be a more youthful and electric red/pink: Amaranth.

While it’s used sparingly for Archilyse, it plays a more prominent role for Archilyse Labs, at the same time creating a visual frame and diversion.
