Archilyse is a Swiss prop-tech startup that was founded by academics of the ETH Zürich. The unique approach combines an object’s floor plan and other project-specific info with publicly available data about its environment, such as sunlight, traffic intensity, air condition, public transportation etc. 

The results are unmatched architectural analysis empowered by machine learning and automatization.

## Two sides of one medal 
Archilyse is trying to bridge the rather traditional and conservative Swiss real estate market with the vibrant and progressive field of AI and data science. 

To develop a brand is very much like developing a character. It has to be like- and approachable but without edge, it‘s prone to being generic and thus be forgotten.

Working with brand personas is a tool we find very useful to establish and share an understanding of what a brand should convey. As it takes away a lot of the abstractness, it is a great way to include everyone within an organization in the process.

The instantaneous way of discussing and iterating about a brand provided by a workshop makes it efficient and – to be honest – way more fun. 

So together with the founders, we developed a dual-brand structure that allowed to cater to both stakeholder groups without diluting the brand’s identity.

Archilyse is the effective, innovative and technocratic brand. As a SaaS, it’s market-oriented and profit driven. It’s a rather humorless affair and communication is always straight to the point.

Archilyse Labs is Archilyse’s sub-brand and represents the research and development department. It is a mostly autonomous unit, which fulfills its functions with its own brand identity. In contrast to Archilyse, it’s an open, inclusive and outgoing brand, intended to appeal to young and international academics.

Both brands fulfill their own, designated tasks and cater to their specific audiences, shielding each other from negative effects and utilizing synergy where desirable.

## Deriving the visual identity
![Font preview Weissenhof](/cases/branding_archilyse/font.svg)

The Weissenhof Grotesk font struck us as the perfect choice for Archilyse. It is a constructed geometric sans serif font and is inspired by the Weissenhof Estate, an avant-garde building complex, built in 1927 in Stuttgart, Germany.

The color palette had to be able to cater to the demands of both sides of the brand and their respective target audiences. We focused mainly on the business-centric SaaS brand Archilyse and chose a classic set of blue and petrol. The accent color, however, was selected to be a more youthful and electric red/pink: Amaranth.

While it’s used sparingly for Archilyse, it plays a more prominent role for the Archilyse Labs, creating a visual frame and diversion at the same time.
