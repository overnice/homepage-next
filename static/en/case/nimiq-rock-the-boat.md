The Web3 Summit is a well-respected and high-quality conference. The organizers implemented a no-promotion policy, and with good reason, as many conferences are riddled with rampant advertisements, bought speaking opportunities and massive sponsoring. 

We had to be careful not to draw the anger of the organizers or visitors for encroaching on their no-bullshit conference.

To justify breaking the rule, we had to come up with something that would create attention in a meaningful way — in a way that added value, not only for attendees but hopefully for the organizers as well.

The rough idea: Get a boat, put a giant billboard on it, develop a cryptocurrency faucet, embed it in a nice web app and link to it from the giant QR code displayed on the billboard.

## From idea to execution in under two weeks
We found ourselves with a concept  and less than two weeks to put it into action and— most importantly —to  decide whether it was actually a good idea, and whether we had the guts to take the risk.

From trouble with the German water police to hate from the community to simply not being able to finish the app in time — the list of things that could go wrong was daunting.

In the end, the reason we ran with it was the team’s spirit. We and Team Nimiq liked the idea and were ready to do something bold. 

## The beauty of the struggle

While the developers worked overtime, the billboard was set up by our trusted handymen, and a user experience that pushed Nimiq’s ease-of-use principle even further was designed.

We had to cross about 50km of German rivers and lakes to get the boat to its designated 
place of action, even moving our office onboard while we put the finishing touches on everything.

Stormy weather, bridges that were almost too low to pass, the motor dying minutes before the event, the police, the app itself — it all worked like a charm in the end. Even the organizers seemed to like the attention and appreciate the effort we had put into their summit.

## The app behind the boat
Visitors could scan the QR code or visit [getsome.nimiq.com](https://getsome.nimiq.com/) to create a cryptocurrency wallet in their phone’s browser and receive 1000 NIM – all in under two minutes. 

If they felt like continuing with their experience they could visit the Nimiq online shop and try the online checkout experience, spending their NIM on merch or browsing the Nimiq app ecosystem.

## Results
In total, [getsome.nimiq.com](https://getsome.nimiq.com/) was opened 792 times by 682 unique visitors, of whom 85% successfully created a wallet in their browser. Many more saw Nimiq’s freshly redesigned brand, with the boat being positioned at the sole entry point to the conference.
